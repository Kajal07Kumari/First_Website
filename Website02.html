            <h2>About Missiles</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Missiles are the weapon that is self-propelled or directed by remote control,carrying conventional or nuclear explosive. Missiles are classified into two types 1:Cruise missile 2:Ballistic missile. 
                <br><br>
                Ballistic missiles follow parabolic path and it goes in the upper layer of atmosphere. Ballistic missiles are based on the rocket technology it becomes to much destructive by acquiring a lot of speed in the influence of gravity. Cruise missiles flies in the lower level of atmosphere due to which it is very hard to caught by the radar. Cruise missile are based on the jet technology. Bharamos missile is the world’s deadliest cruise missile is the world deadliest cruise missile.

               <h2>Cruise Missile</h2>
            </div>
            <p>A cruise missile is an Unmanned Self-propelled Guided vehicle that sustains flight through Aerodynamic Lift. Bhramos and subsonic missile nirbhay  are the examples of cruise missile that are commonly used by India. We do not require a launcher to launch cruise missile. It can be launched by land or air. 
                <br><br>
                The speed of this missile is constant. After launching, the target can be changed when a cruise missile is used. Nowadays, a cruise missiles come with a camera using this, we can control it from the control room and see whether the target has been hit or not. The precision of such missile is high.

                <h2>Ballestic Missile</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Ballistic missile is a missile that has a ballistic trajectory over the most of its flight path, regardless of weapon delivery vehicle. It is used to destroy big targets because it is able to carry more war head than cruise missile, but its accuracy is very less than a cruise missile.
                <br><br>
                These missile can be launched only from ground and it require a launcher. After being launched the speed of ballistic missiles varies. It crosses the earth’s atmosphere and its speed keeps decreasing due to earth’s gravitational force. Once it re-enter the atmosphere, the speed of this missile is very high.
            </p>
